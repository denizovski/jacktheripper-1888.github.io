<h2 class="title-medium-dark size-c26">LOCATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MURDERS</h2>

<p>The map of Jack the Ripper&#39;s London shows the locations of many of the places associated with the Whitechapel Murders.</p>
<p>Looking at the murder sites today the first thing that strikes you is the smallness of the locality in which the murders occurred.</p>
<p>However, it should also be remembered that in 1888 the area was made up of lots of narrow, unlit alleyways and passageways and it was the labyrinth-like layout of the area that enabled jack the Ripper to commit his crimes and then melt away into the night.</p>
